At the end, i believe i did a good job and boost my motivation with the things that i used.
I Always open to any comments.
```css
body {
 background-color: var(--LightGray);
 font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
 display: flex;
 flex-direction: column;
 align-items: center;
 justify-content: center;
}

### Continued development

I would like to make my own grid testimonal Card section so this could be used as a default template.

The Testimonial grid card could be links to a document or something along those ways. Going to think about something useful that could come in handy.
